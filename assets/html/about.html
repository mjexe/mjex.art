			<div class="header">
				My name is Max Lessard and I make art with cameras. My primary focus is cinematography, lighting and sound design because I enjoy telling stories through films and I believe those three things are the most important components of getting a story told in the most engaging way.<br>
				<br>
				Beyond video I also have a passion for the art of photography and always have a good quality camera within arms reach because the right moment could be any time.
